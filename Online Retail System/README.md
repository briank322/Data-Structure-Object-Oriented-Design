In this project you will write code to model a very simplified version of an online retail system such as Amazon. In this project you will read a database of products from certain categories as well as users and their associated information. Your program will then allow a user to interactively search for products based on certain keywords returning the products that match the search. From those matches, your program will allow a user to add select items to their "cart", view items in their cart, purchase the items in their cart, and save the updated database of product and user information.
