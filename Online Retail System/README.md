<Amazon.cpp>
----------------
In this project you will write code to model a very simplified version of an online retail system such as Amazon. In this project you will read a database of products from certain categories as well as users and their associated information. Your program will then allow a user to interactively search for products based on certain keywords returning the products that match the search. From those matches, your program will allow a user to add select items to their "cart", view items in their cart, purchase the items in their cart, and save the updated database of product and user information.\
To actually run the program type the following:\
/amazon database.txt (Instead of database.txt you can use any txt file as a database.)\
To quit the program, and get a result as an output, type "QUIT database.new".\ 
Below are the instruction how to use this program.\
